# t2-skins

This repository contains custom fan-made skins for Tribes 2 in order to serve
them via GitHub Pages, where they can be loaded by
[t2-model-skinner](https://github.com/exogen/t2-model-skinner).

Itâ€™s a separate repository so that it can be deployed separately, since
deploying the large collection of skins to GitHub Pages is slow.

If you plan to work on [t2-model-skinner](https://github.com/exogen/t2-model-skinner),
you will need a working copy of this repository, either as a sibling of `t2-model-skinner`
or pointed to by the `T2_SKINS_PATH` environment variable.
